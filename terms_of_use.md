# Terms of Use for Tapi Photo

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

Welcome to Tapi Photo (the "App"). These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

## 1. The Service

Tapi Photo provides a platform for users to edit images and generate visual content using artificial intelligence and server-side processing. The Service relies on a system of virtual credits ("Tokens") to perform specific actions, such as high-quality image generation or advanced editing features.

## 2. User License and Restrictions

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to use the App for personal and commercial purposes regarding your generated content.

You expressly agree that you will not, under any circumstances:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the App or any related technology.
- Interfere with or circumvent the Token system, including utilizing exploits to generate images without valid Token deduction.
- Use the Service to generate content that involves child sexual abuse material (CSAM), violence, hate speech, or any content prohibited by applicable laws.
- Use the App in a way that places an unreasonable load on our server infrastructure (e.g., through automated scripts or botting).

## 3. Privacy and Device Registration

Your privacy is important to us. Unlike many apps, we minimize data collection; however, the nature of our token-based system requires specific technical data.

- **Device Registration:** To manage your account and secure your purchased Tokens, we collect specific device identifiers (id, model, manufacturer, hardware specs). This allows us to restore your balance if you reinstall the App.
- **Processing:** Images are processed on our servers for editing purposes and are not stored permanently.
- Please refer to our Privacy Policy for a full detailed explanation of our data practices.

## 4. In-App Purchases and Tokens

The App offers the ability to purchase virtual Tokens via Google Play.

- **Usage:** Tokens are used solely to access specific features within the App (e.g., generating an image).
- **No Monetary Value:** Tokens have no cash value, are non-transferable, and cannot be redeemed for cash or other currency.
- **Refunds:** All purchases are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the policies of the Google Play Store.

## 5. Intellectual Property Rights

- **The App:** All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (code, design, interface, and AI implementation) are and will remain the exclusive property of Tapi Photo and its licensors.
- **Your Content:** We do not claim ownership of the images you upload or the final images you generate. You retain all rights to your creations.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

**THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TAPI PHOTO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE IMAGE GENERATION WILL ALWAYS MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR BE ERROR-FREE.**

## 7. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TAPI PHOTO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA (INCLUDING TOKENS LOST DUE TO DEVICE FAILURE WITHOUT BACKUP), USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.**

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tapi Photo and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms.

## 9. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the restrictions in Section 2 regarding illegal content generation or system exploits.

## 10. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Poland, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
